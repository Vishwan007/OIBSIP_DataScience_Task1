# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task1

Goal: The main goal of this task is to predict the species of an iris flower from its physical measuremnets obtained from the dataset.

Pattern Recognition: Used to learn the relationship between flower features and species.

Supervised Learning: Build a classification model using labeled data.

Accuracy & Generalization: Ensure the model predicts correctly on unseen data.

Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.

WorkFlow: Intially we started with the collection of the dataset and converted the dataset into the format of a dataframe using the pandas inbuilt library of python. In this project I used seaborn and matplotlib to plot the graphs that help us to understand about the dataset in a proper manner. After this i splitted the data into the training as well as the testing data. Here in this task I used the Logistic Regression as well the Decision Tree to check which model perfoms good on the basis of the accuracy score. As I got the Decision Tree accuracy as 96% so i used the Decision tree classifier to obtain the results.
